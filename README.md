## 🖼️ Project Overview & Screenshot

App Hub solves the problem of scattered application discovery by bringing multiple apps into a single, organized platform. Users can quickly find what they need through robust search and categorization features and initiate downloads directly from the site. This project is built for scalability to handle a growing library of applications.
